Plan
Kyle Hong(sh394)

what to include in Game Scene
1. a paddle controlled by keyboard inputs
2. a bouncing ball in angular movement
3. collision detection( collision between the wall and the ball, collision between the paddle and the ball)
4. Life Display(loses a life when the ball goes below the bottom edge, resets the ball with some delays(3s) and texts(Get Ready!), display a message the player lost if a player loses 5 lives)
5. Score Display-
6. different types of bricks - bricks that give you useful items,  multi-hit breakable bricks, multi-colored bricks
7. Items(Power ups)- Spaceship- laser shots from the paddle, Bombs- will lose a life if the bomb hits the paddle. Points power- will give bonus points, Size Power- will make the paddle bigger, Life Ball- add one more life
8. different types of levels- level 1 -normal breakout, level2- more multi-hit breakable bricks  level 3- simple versus mode

what to include in Main Scene
	1. Play Button
	2. Help Button(Includes Text, and Back button)

what to include in Win Scene(if the user completes all three levels)
	1. display a text that the user has won
	2.Home Button

what to include in Lose Scene
	1.display a text that the user has lost
	2.Home Button

Cheat Code- gets the user input using dialog- if the user input string matches following cheat codes
list of cheat codes
1. ”hawaiian shirt” -> Instant win
2.”show me the score“-> + 1000 score


Something Extra
Very simple versus mode-
The last level of the game will be a battle between the user and the computer. I will add a paddle controlled by the computer(simply follows the user's paddle). If the user gets 15 blocks faster than the computer, the user will win.

Why I think it is a substantial addition? - it gives a player motivation to play to the end
